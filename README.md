Development Process
Data Models: Define classes in the models directory to represent movies, genres, and other relevant data structures.

API Services: Create classes in the services directory to handle fetching movie data from a suitable API (e.g., TMDB). Implement methods for searching, fetching trending and popular movies, and retrieving details for individual movies.

Home Screen UI: Develop the home screen user interface (home_screen.dart) using Flutter widgets. This includes:

Search Bar: Implement a text field using TextField widget that triggers a search on submit or text change.
Featured Movies/Trending: Use a CarouselSlider widget to showcase trending or featured movies with image and title.
Genres: Create a list or grid using ListView or GridView widgets to display movie genres. Allow user selection for filtering.
Top Rated/Popular Movies: Use a section with a list or grid to display movies with high ratings or popularity.
Upcoming Releases: Implement a dedicated section to display upcoming movies.
Personalized Recommendations: (Optional) Utilize user watch history or preferences (implement logic for storing and retrieving) to suggest relevant movies.
Search Results Page UI: Design the search results screen (search_results_screen.dart) with:

Persistent Search Bar: Allow users to refine their search without leaving the page.
Filter Options: Use Dropdown or Checkbox widgets to filter results by genre, release year, rating etc. Update the displayed results based on user selections.
Sort Options: Implement sorting by relevance, rating, release date using Dropdown widgets. Reorder the results based on user selection.
Movie Thumbnails: Display movie posters, titles, and basic information using Image and Text widgets.
Pagination or Infinite Scroll: Implement controls like buttons or automatic loading for browsing through multiple pages of results (consider using easy_refresh).
Movie Details Page UI: Build the movie details screen (movie_details_screen.dart) with:

Movie Poster: Display a high-resolution image using the Image widget.
Title and Year: Show the movie's title and release year with Text widgets.
Rating: Display user and critic ratings using FlutterRating widgets
